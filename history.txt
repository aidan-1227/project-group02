~pip install virtualenv
If says not added to path, 
Go to home directory (cd ~) and open or create the file [.bashrc]
Append to that file 
=export PATH="$PATH:/var/lib/postgresql/.local/bin"
Then save and quit, and run
~source ~/.bashrc
Then create a virtual environment
~virtualenv venv
To run it, run
~source ./venv/bin/activate
Once its open, install flask (this will install it temporarily as long as the virtual environment is open)

For testing purposes: 
As of right now the python file is called [backend.py] (real creative ik) so to start the server, run this while in the folder [/project-group02$]
~python3 backend.py
Then open the file [webpage.html] in the browser of your choice





For me:
Installed psycopg2-binary
